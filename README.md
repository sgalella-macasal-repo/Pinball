# Pinball

###### _Authors: macasal & sgalella_

#### Description

We add our first own-written program. It was done during our first course in Programming and written in C.

It simulates the falling of a ball in a pinball. 4 different available options:
1. Visualizing the game table
2. Print some statistics about the table
3. Simulating 1 ball falling and watching the route it takes in the table
4. Simulating 10 balls fall and observing how many ball have gone through each position in the table

#### Further work
1. Add goal ending for the ball (game mode)
2. Enhance visualization in an external window
3. Generation of random pinballs
